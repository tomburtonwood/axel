      <p>I’ve felt weird.<br>
I’m in a weird headspace.<br>
I’ve never been in this situation before.</p>
<p>Forced to stay at home for the health and safety of not just me but the world. I don’t think I’ve ever felt to anxious and claustrophobic before, like itching to run but having no place to run to. I feel homogenous with the state of the world but disassociated too, with my existence and coping in all of this.</p>
<p>I feel particular about my own personal routine. It seems like I have all the time in the world to see what time I wake up, what I choose to eat and how I decide to spend my time and its really weird to be this conscious instead of being rushed to complete a series of tasks - now I have the ability to space things out and sleep in until 2 or 3 in the afternoon but stay up late until the sun rises. Completely dismissive of the time of the world, I am trapped but not alone.</p>
<p>Whats are the odds that you too feel weird, I’m willing to bet anything that these unprecedented times have led you to come into the realization or the numbing of certain aspects of your life. But here we are, we are all doing it.</p>
<p>During these 8 days I share with you a small portion of my own quarantine. This is not a study of isolation, but the outreach of a common worldwide phenomena that is something we can all relate to in one way or another - whether that be good or bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>best,</p>
